Publication and acknowledgment policy
=====================================

Publications
------------
Please notify salthelp@salt.ac.za of any publication made using SALT data
including reviewed papers and conference proceedings.

Science paper acknowledgements
------------------------------
All science papers that include SALT data which are submitted for publication in
refereed science journals must include the following words of acknowledgment:

“All/some [choose which is appropriate] of the observations reported in this 
paper were obtained with the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) under
program(s) [insert Proposal Code(s)].”

We recommend that the Principle Investigator is also mentioned after the
Proposal Code. In addition, for papers which predominantly based on SALT data,
a footnote symbol should appear after the paper title, and the following text
should be written as a footnote:

"based on observations made with the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT)"

If possible, please also include the Proposal Code and Principle Investigator in
body of the paper when describing observations.

If you use data reduced by the SALT science pipeline or use the PySALT software,
